# Clean Example
Since I'm trying to grow on project's architecture designing, I've always listened about Clean Architecture but I always got lost when talking to my colleagues. So, this project is an attempt to study [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

![Clean architecture schema](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/images/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture.jpg "The clean architecture schema drawing")

However, it's important to point out that I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@manakuro/clean-architecture-with-go-bce409427d31), that is SUPER cool for those that are learning.

I'm also getting used to the Go language, so if you see any typo I ask you to point this out.
Thanks <3
